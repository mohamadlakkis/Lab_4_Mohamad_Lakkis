This repo contains a project tha integrates both TKINTER and PYQT5, using threading, to run both of them at the same time
So the idea is like lab 2, but here the tkinter interface will handle the show for the current courses and the pyqt5 will handle how you can modiy and see them ( so if you remember we did have previously a small section on our pyqt5 where it shows, current register courses, current students ... ) Now all of these are shown in the tkinter ONLY. SO they work simultaneosuly, but of course each time you update something in the main (i.e. pyqt5) you need to refresh the tkinter
